3. Ability to remove a car for a location
4. Ability to replace a car with another car
6. The dealer has promotions that can be assigned to any car (promotions should have their own DB table)
7. List all cars that have a promotion
8. List all promoted cars (display empty promotions as well - query on cars!)
9. List all cars for a location, no matter if they have a promotion or not
10. List all cars for which the promotion ends at a specific date (e.g. the end of the month)
11. List cars by make and/or model and/or year and/or color and/or location
